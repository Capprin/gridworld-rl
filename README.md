# gridworld-rl
A reinforcement learning implementation in a gridworld

## Description
This project trains first visit monte-carlo policy evaluation against a
maximum-value policy. It does so in a gridworld with a learning agent and a
randomly moving target.

## Branches
This project has three branches, each corresponding to a different experiment.

### master
Trains a single learning agent against a single target agent.

### multi-agent
Trains two learning agents against a single target agent.

### multi-agent-collab
Trains two learning agents against a single target agent, with shared rewards.
